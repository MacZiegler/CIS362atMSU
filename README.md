# CIS362atMSU
This is a collection of apps for CIS362, Mobile App Development at Missouri State University

![Logo of the project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/master/sample-logo.png)

## Getting started

Each of the apps built in this repository were created in Android Studio for the Missouri State University (MSU) Mobile App Development class during the fall of 2018.

Android Studio for these began with version 3.1, and ended with version 3.2 (so far! note - finalize at project end)

There is just zero guarantee these will work with anything else at all. Honestly, there are no guarantees here anything will work at all!

## Developing

You are welcome to do whatever you would like with this collection of code. The great majority of it was taken directly from the textbook and modified to run with the (then) latest version of Android Studio.

```shell
<TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:text="Hello World!"
         />
```

## Android Studio Apps

The apps in this repository include:
* HelloGoodbye
* BurgerCalorieCounter
* Calculator
* Paintings

## Contributing

I truly do not expect any contributions to this repository. The whole thing is only here to store and track my progress in a single class at school.

If this helps anyone else, that's just a massive bonus. Meanwhile, browse or branch or download to your heart's content.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Android Developer Site: http://developer.android.com/

  - All reasonable efforts have been taken to comply with the Missouri State University Academic Integrity Policy: http://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op3_01_AcademicIntegrityStudents.htm

## Licensing

Does this need licensing? I would like to list it as something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."

...but I am just not sure whether I should or whether it is necessary or even whether it has some sort of prohibition.
